## 🔧 WORKFLOW DETERMINATION LOGIC

### Rules for Automatic Workflow Routing:

1. **If `directorate` is NULL or empty:**
   - Unit reports to Chief Director
   - Workflow: `EMPLOYEE → SUPERVISOR → UNIT_HEAD → CHIEF_DIRECTOR → HR_OFFICER`

2. **If `directorate` = "Finance & Administration":**
   - Standard workflow: `EMPLOYEE → SUPERVISOR → UNIT_HEAD → DIRECTOR → HR_OFFICER`
   - **Exception**: If `unit` = "Human Resource Management Unit (HRMU)":
     - Special workflow: `EMPLOYEE → SUPERVISOR → UNIT_HEAD → DIRECTOR → HR_DIRECTOR → HR_OFFICER`

3. **If `directorate` = "Policy, Planning, Monitoring & Evaluation (PPME)":**
   - Standard workflow: `EMPLOYEE → SUPERVISOR → UNIT_HEAD → DIRECTOR → HR_OFFICER`

4. **If `unit` = "Internal Audit Unit":**
   - Standard workflow applies
   - Unit Head has `AUDITOR` role for read-only access to all records
   - But approval workflow still follows standard path

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Database Fields Needed:
- `directorate` - Already exists
- `division` - Already exists (not used in this structure)
- `unit` - Already exists
- `immediateSupervisorId` - Already exists
- `managerId` - Already exists (for team assignment)

### Workflow Logic Updates Needed:
1. Detect if unit is under Chief Director (no directorate)
2. Detect HRMU special case
3. Route to appropriate director based on unit/directorate

---

## ✅ NEXT STEPS

1. Update workflow determination logic to handle all unit cases
2. Create unit mapping configuration
3. Test workflows for each unit type
4. Document supervisor assignments per unit
