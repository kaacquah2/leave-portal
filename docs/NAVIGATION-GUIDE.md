# Navigation Guide

## How to Navigate in the App

The HR Leave Portal uses a tab-based navigation system with sidebar menu and browser-style navigation controls.

### Navigation Methods

#### 1. **Sidebar Navigation (Primary)**
- **Location**: Left sidebar (desktop) or hamburger menu (mobile)
- **Usage**: Click on any menu item to navigate to that section
- **Available Sections**:
  - Dashboard
  - Staff Management / My Team
  - Leave Management / Approve Leaves
  - Reports
  - Calendar
  - And more based on your role

#### 2. **Browser Navigation Controls (Desktop Only)**
- **Location**: Top right of the header, next to your role label
- **Controls**:
  - **Back Button** (←): Navigate to the previous page/tab
  - **Forward Button** (→): Navigate forward (if you've gone back)
  - **Home Button** (🏠): Return to the Dashboard

#### 3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- **Browser Back**: `Alt + Left Arrow` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + [` (Mac)
- **Browser Forward**: `Alt + Right Arrow` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + ]` (Mac)

#### 4. **URL-Based Navigation**
- The app uses query parameters for navigation
- Example: `/?tab=dashboard`, `/?tab=leave`, `/?tab=staff`
- You can bookmark specific tabs
- Browser back/forward buttons work with tab navigation

### Navigation Features

### Common Navigation Scenarios

#### Going Back
1. **Using Back Button**: Click the ← button in the header (desktop only)
2. **Using Browser Back**: Use your browser's back button or keyboard shortcut
3. **Using Sidebar**: Click on a different tab in the sidebar

#### Returning to Dashboard
1. **Using Home Button**: Click the 🏠 button in the header (desktop only)

### Tips

1. **Bookmarking**: You can bookmark specific tabs by copying the URL
2. **History**: Browser history works with tab navigation
3. **Mobile**: Use the hamburger menu for easier navigation on small screens
4. **Active Tab**: The currently active tab is highlighted in blue with a left border

### Troubleshooting

#### Navigation Not Working
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if you're logged in
- Clear browser cache if issues persist

#### Can't See Navigation Controls
- Navigation controls are only visible on desktop
- On mobile, use the hamburger menu (☰) in the top-left
- Make sure your browser window is wide enough

#### Back Button Not Working
- The back button uses browser history
- If you just opened the app, there's no history to go back to
- Use the sidebar to navigate instead

**Note**: Navigation behavior may vary slightly between web browser and Electron app, but the core functionality remains the same.
