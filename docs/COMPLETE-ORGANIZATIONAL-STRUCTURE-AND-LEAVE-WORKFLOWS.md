## 🔍 Workflow Determination Logic

The system automatically determines the correct workflow based on:

1. **Staff Position**: Director, Unit Head, Supervisor, Employee
2. **Organizational Unit**: Core Directorate or Independent Unit
3. **Directorate**: Which directorate staff belongs to
4. **Role**: System role assignment

**Priority Order**:
1. Check if Director → Use Director workflow
2. Check if Unit Head → Use Unit Head workflow
3. Check if HRMD staff → Use HRMD workflow
4. Check if Independent Unit → Use Independent Unit workflow
5. Default → Use Standard Employee workflow

---

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Database Fields Used

- `StaffMember.position` - Determines if Director/Unit Head
- `StaffMember.unit` - Determines unit assignment
- `StaffMember.directorate` - Determines directorate
- `StaffMember.immediateSupervisorId` - Determines supervisor
- `StaffMember.actingOfficerId` - Required for critical positions

### Approval Step Tracking

Each approval level is tracked in `ApprovalStep` table:
- `level` - Sequential level (1, 2, 3, ...)
- `approverRole` - Required role for approval
- `status` - pending | approved | rejected
- `previousLevelCompleted` - Enforces sequential approval

### Compliance Validation

Before each approval:
1. Check self-approval prevention
2. Check acting officer assignment (if required)
3. Check leave balance
4. Check HR validation (if applicable)
5. Check external clearance (if applicable)
6. Check sequential approval order
